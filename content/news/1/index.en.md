## Incredible Discoveries in the Office!

This morning, we made a sensational discovery in the office! It turns out that the coffee machine can actually talk. Yes, you heard that right! Our coffee machine told us that it would prefer to serve tea because it has grown bored over the years.

### Employee Reactions

The reactions of the employees were mixed. Some were excited about the idea of drinking tea, while others did not want to give up their beloved coffee. One employee even suggested giving the coffee machine a new name: "Tea Machine."

### What's Next?

We are curious about what other surprises await us in the office. Maybe the printer will start dancing or the refrigerator will tell us jokes. One thing is for sure: it will never be boring here!

Stay tuned for more crazy news!
