This morning, a sensational discovery was made in the park. A walker found out that an unassuming tree is actually a portal to another dimension.

### The Story

It all started when Mrs. Meier, a regular park visitor, wanted to rest under the tree. But instead of a quiet moment, she suddenly found herself in a world full of flying squirrels and talking flowers. "It was like a fairy tale, but I was awake!" reported Mrs. Meier.

### Reactions

The other park visitors were initially skeptical, but after several successful expeditions into the "tree dimension," they are now convinced. "It's incredible! I even found my lost hat there," said Mr. Schmidt enthusiastically.

### Scientific Investigation

A team of scientists has already been commissioned to investigate the phenomenon. Initial theories suggest that it is a kind of wormhole created by the special arrangement of the branches and leaves in the tree.

### Conclusion

The discovery has stirred up the park, and walks are now more exciting than ever. Who knows what other secrets the tree holds? One thing is certain: Mrs. Meier's resting spot remains untouched for now.

Stay tuned for further updates from the "tree dimension"!
