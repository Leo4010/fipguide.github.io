### Luxembourg

In both cases, an additional ticket for the German section of DB is required. The Eurostar (formerly Thalys) can also be used from Germany to reach the SNCB network. Here, a special FIP ticket from Eurostar is required for the entire section (including within Belgium) (see Eurostar page).

## Discounts

Children up to 5 years old travel free on SNCB trains. Children aged 6 to 11 are eligible for a 50% discount on the adult fare, and from 12 years old they pay the adult fare. If they are FIP eligible, they also pay only half the normal price for FIP 50. [^1]

## Special Fares

### Brussels Zaventem Airport

For connections to and from Brussels Zaventem Airport, a surcharge must be paid for the FIP free travel pass. This currently amounts to 6.70 euros (see [SNCB info](https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/tickets-and-railcards/airports/brussels-airport)). For FIP 50 tickets, this is already included in the price.

## Experiences

The 1st class in SNCB / NMBS trains is often used with 2nd class tickets. Also, the 1st class is usually not much more comfortable than the 2nd class. Unlike in other countries, buying 1st class tickets to have more space and quiet is only worthwhile to a limited extent.
