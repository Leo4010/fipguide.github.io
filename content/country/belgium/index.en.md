Belgium, the land of waffles, chocolate, and fries! Here, there are more castles per square kilometer than anywhere else in the world. The Belgians speak three official languages: Dutch, French, and German, which means they have three times as many opportunities to complain about the weather. And let's not forget the famous Belgian beers â€“ there are over 1,000 different varieties! Cheers to Belgium!
